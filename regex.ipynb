Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines\nagainst COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. On the other hand, infection\nrates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including challenges\nand increases in costs for logistics and supply chains, such as increased port congestion, intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor\nsupply.
